## The Challenge
1. This project is a spin on the original 100 Days of Cloud Challenge. The idea is to revise it to 100 projects or tasks done in hopefully less than 100 days. You can read about the orginal challenge and register for it at [#100DaysOfCloud.com](https://100DaysOfCloud.com)
2. There's a Discord Channel at [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/c6Db8nY)
3. This project's template was downloaded at [100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloud Journey Template](https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloud/generate)
4. Other templates include [Micro](Templates/000-DAY-ARTICLE-MICRO-TEMPLATE.md), [Short](Templates/001-DAY-ARTICLE-SHORT-TEMPLATE.md) or [Long](Templates/002-DAY-ARTICLE-LONG-TEMPLATE.md) Day Journey Template and can be used to document my day-to-day progress.
5. Further ideas for the challenges can be found at [#100DaysOfCloudIdeas](https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloudIdeas)

## Rose's Cloud Journey

I have embarked on an exciting journey to delve into the realm of cloud computing through the '100 Days of Cloud/Project' challenge. This project represents a pivotal step in my career transition, as I am eager to gain hands-on experience in this dynamic field. My enthusiasm stems from the belief that immersing myself in this challenge will not only broaden my knowledge but also unlock new opportunities in the world of cloud computing. I look forward to the growth and insights this endeavor will bring as I navigate the transformative landscape of cloud technology. 

At the conclusion of the "100 Days of Cloud" challenge, my objective is to have undergone a significant transformation, equipping myself with the knowledge and skills required for an AWS Solution Architect role. I aspire to possess a profound understanding of cloud technologies, hands-on experience in deploying and managing AWS solutions, and the confidence to excel in architecting cloud-based systems.

By immersing myself in this intensive journey, I am preparing myself to become a well-rounded professional capable of designing and implementing complex cloud solutions on the AWS platform. This endeavor not only aligns with my passion for cloud computing but also positions me as a competitive candidate for an AWS Solution Architect role, where I can contribute effectively to the design and optimization of cloud infrastructures for businesses and organizations.
